<H2>NAME</H2>

flog --- speed up a process
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2>

<B>flog</B>

[<B>-l</B> <I>n</I>]

[<B>-a</B> <I>m</I>]

[<B>-u</B>]

process-id
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>Flog</I>

is used to stimulate an improvement in the performance of a process
that is already in execution.
The
<I>process-id</I>

is the process number of the process that is to be
disciplined.
<P>

The value
<I>n</I>

of the
<B>-l</B>

flag is the flagellation constant,
i.e., the number of
<I>lashes</I>

to be administered per minute.
If this argument is omitted, the default is 17,
which is the most random random number.
<P>

The value
<I>m</I>

of the
<B>-a</B>

flag is the number of times the
inducement to speed up is to be
<I>administered</I>.

If this argument is omitted, the default is one,
which is based on the possibility that after that
the process will rectify its behavior of its own volition.
<P>

The presence of the
<B>-u</B>

flag indicates that
<I>flog</I>

is to be
<I>unmerciful</I>

in its actions.
This nullifies the effects of the other keyletter arguments.
It is recommended that
this option be used only on extremely stubborn processes,
as its over-use may have detrimental effects.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>FILES</H2>

<I>Flog</I>

will read the file
<I>/have/mercy</I>

for any entry containing the process-id of the
process being speeded-up.
The file can contain whatever
supplications are deemed necessary, but, of course, these will
be ignored if the
<B>-u</B>

flag is supplied.
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SEE ALSO</H2>

<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DIAGNOSTICS</H2>

If a named process does not exist,
<I>flog</I>

replies ``flog you'' on the standard output.
If
<I>flog</I>

happens to
<I><A HREF="http://localhost/cgi-bin/man/man2html?2+kill">kill</A></I>(2)

the process, which usually happens when the
<B>-u</B>

keyletter argument is supplied, it writes ``RIP,'' followed by the
process-id of the deceased, on the standard output.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUGS</H2>

Spurious supplications for mercy by the process being
flogged sometimes wind up on the standard output, rather than in
<I>/shut/up</I>.
