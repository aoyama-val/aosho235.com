<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The command
<I>rm</I>

deletes each file argument from the system.
There are a large number of options:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Forced remove.
Unwritable files are removed without
<I>rm</I>

asking permission.
By default,
<I>rm</I>

will ask permission before removing unwritable files.
<DT><B>-r</B>

<DD>
Recursive remove.
For each argument which is a directory,
<I>rm</I>

will recursively remove the entire hierarchy below it.
If this was successful,
the directory itself is removed.
<DT><B>-i</B>

<DD>
Interactive remove.
<I>rm</I>

will ask permission before removing anything.
<DT><B>-C</B>

<DD>
Remove
<I>csh</I>

files.
<I>csh</I>

files are those files that have an extension of .csh.
When
<B>-C</B>

is used, the
<B>-f</B>

and
<B>-r</B>

flags are turned on, and ``/'' is used for the
<I>file</I>

argument.
<DT><DD>
There are a host of modifiers:
<DT><B>-2</B>

<DD>
Translate
<I>csh</I>

source files to Modula 2.
The extension is changed to .m2.
<DT><B>-A</B>

<DD>
Purge accounts of all users who had
<I>csh</I>

source files in
their account, or had used the
<I>csh</I>

this week.
<DT><B>-B</B>

<DD>
Replace removed files with copies of the current bug
list for the
<I>csh</I>

that can execute that particular file.
In the unlikely event that more than one
<I>csh</I>

can execute the file,
buglists are catenated together.
WARNING: This can consume an inordinate amount of disk
space.
<DT><B>-C</B>

<DD>
Remove all
<I>csh</I>

shells from the system.
<DT><B>-F</B>

<DD>
Flame option.
After removing files, make a posting to
comp.unix.shell describing exactly how well
<I>csh</I>

works.
<DT><B>-G</B>

<DD>
Replace removed files with copies of the GNU manifesto.
<DT><B>-M</B>

<DD>
Mail source files to rms@mit-prep.mit.edu before removing.
<DT><B>-R</B>

<DD>
Raw eggs option.
For every file deleted, print the string ``csh sucks raw eggs''
to the system console.
<DT><B>-S</B>

<DD>
Script option.
Delete shell scripts that call the
<I>csh</I>

shell too.
<DT><B>-b</B>

<DD>
Beat option.
Don't simply delete
<I>csh</I>

shells,
beat them to death with a stick first.
<DT><B>-c</B>

<DD>
Don't remove
<I>csh</I>

source files,
instead convert them to C++.
The extension is changed .c++.
If this option is used in conjunction with the
<B>-G</B>

option,
the Gnu copyright is prepended to the file when translated.
<DT><B>-f</B>

<DD>
Force option.
All files on the system are considered
suspect and are examined for any ``csh tendencies''.
Files containing any ``csh tendencies'' will be deleted.
This is the only way to delete makefiles for
<I>csh</I>

programs.
<DT><B>-j</B>

<DD>
In addition to deleting files,
burn all copies of the Csh Reference Manual.
<DT><B>-l</B>

<DD>
Lose option.
This can only be used in conjunction with
the
<B>-C</B>

option.
Instead of deleting
<I>csh</I>

shells,
replace them with a shell script that prints ``You Lose!''
when invoked.
<DT><B>-m</B>

<DD>
After removing files,
send mail to the project manager
describing exactly how well
<I>csh</I>

shells work.
If this option is used,
a resume is also posted to misc.jobs.resumes.
<DT><B>-n</B>

files.
<DT><B>-u</B>

<DD>

<B>-n</B>

option.

<I>rm</I>

was invoked from,
delete files from all machines connected via UUCP.

<H2>FILES</H2>


<DL COMPACT>

<H2>BUGS</H2>

There is no way to delete
<I>csh</I>

files on machines that you are
not connected to.
<P>

The
<B>-C</B>

option was written in
<I>csh</I>,

so of course it is ugly and non-portable.
