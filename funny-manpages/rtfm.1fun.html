wrath of God.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

<B>rtfm </B>

only checks
<B>/var/run/luser</B>

when the
<B>-a</B>

option is specified and after the 
<B>-i</B>

option is invoked. Otherwise 
<B>/tmp </B>

would fill up rapidly on many systems. Also, core may dump if the 
<B>-a FILE= </B>

option is anatomically impossible.
